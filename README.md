# LiverCancerDetector
Liver Cancer Detector based on HCC dataset.
It is a CatBoost Model,which helps to fight against sever noises in Cancer data with Symmestric Tree,L2 regulations.
And empty value would be filled in automatically by CatBoost.

I employed Bayesian Tuning to optimize parameters.

Next time,I shall oversampling with GAN-generated data to prevent overfitting and promote the robustness of my model.
